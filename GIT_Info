***Brief history of version control:***

1) First Generation
	- Single-file
	- No Networking
	- ex: SCCS, RCS
	
2) Second Generation
	- Multi-file
	- Centralized
	- ex: CVS, VSS, SVN, TFS, Perforce

3) Third Generation
	- Changesets
	- Distributed
	- ex: Git, Hg, Bazaar, BitKeeper

***Advantages of DVCS***

1) Different topologies
	- Centralized
		-> Developers push changes to one central repository
	- Hierarchial
		-> Developers push changes to sub-system based repositories
		-> Sub-system repositories are periodically merged into a main repository
	- Distributed
		-> Developers push changes to their own repository
		-> Project maintainers pull changes into the official repository

2) Backups are easy
	- Each clone is a full backup
	
3) Reliable branching/merging
	- Feature branches
	- Always work under version control
	- Applying fixed to different branches

4) Full local history
	- Compute repository statistics
	- Analyze regressions

5) New Ideas
	- Deployment
		-> git push heroku prod_branch
